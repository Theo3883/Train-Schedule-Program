**C++ Train Schedule Program**
------------------------------

### Features of this project:

1. **Train Schedule Management**: Allows users to manage train schedules, including adding, updating, and deleting train timings.

2. **Station Information**: Provides detailed information about various train stations, including facilities and services available.

3. **Route Planning**: Helps users plan their journey by providing optimal routes and connections between different train stations.

4. **Real-time Updates**: Reflects real-time updates on train timings and delays, ensuring users have the latest information.

5. **Ticket Booking**: Integrates with a ticket booking system to allow users to book tickets directly from the application.

6. **User Authentication**: Ensures secure access to the application with user authentication and authorization features.

7. **Notifications**: Sends notifications to users about train delays, cancellations, and other important updates.

8. **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent user experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile platforms.

9. **Shortest Route Algorithm**: Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two train stations. The algorithm works by initializing the distance to the start station as zero and all other distances as infinity. It then iteratively selects the station with the smallest known distance, updates the distances to its neighbors, and marks it as processed. This process continues until the shortest path to the destination station is found.

and many more, including code architecture and reusability.
